# Arrow

<p style="background: #ddd; padding: 1rem; text-align: center; color: black;">
  <em>Arrow is currently in development and should not be used in production environments.</em>
</p>

Arrow is a minimal static site generator and a content management 
system for independent websites.

> The focus is on writing, not website maintenance.

It’s ideal for people who want to own their content but 
don’t want to dedicate too much time to maintaining a website or blog. 


## Features

Arrow includes all the features of **wruby**:

* Fast, OS-agnostic site generator
* Auto-generated, valid [RSS feed](/index.rss)
* Custom `header.html` and `footer.html` templates
* Not much else (this is a *good* thing!)

Plus:

* An easy-to-use CMS for writer happiness.
* A stylesheet that favors simplicity and readability
* Automated tasks to build and deploy site
* Free hosting over Github Pages
