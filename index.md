# Arrow

Arrow is a terminal-based content management system

## Features

All the features of **wruby**:

* Fast, OS-agnostic site generator
* Auto-generated, valid [RSS feed](/index.rss)
* Custom `header.html` and `footer.html` templates
* Not much else (this is a *good* thing!)

Plus:

* An easy-to-use CMS for writer happiness.
