Arrow is a minimal static site generator and a content management 
system for independently managed websites, 
favoring simplicity and readability.

It's ideal for people who want to own their content 
but don't want to dedicate too much time to maintaining
a website. The focus is writing, not website maintenance.

Arrow assumes familiarity with markdown and the terminal.
The basic workflow of publishing content on an Arrow website 
consists of creating markdown files, editing them with a 
text editor, and publishing from the terminal.
