# About Arrow

<p style="background: #ddd; padding: 0.5rem">
  <em>Arrow is currently in development and should not be used in production environments.</em>

Arrow is a minimal static site generator and a content management 
system for independent websites.

It’s ideal for tech-savvy people who want to own their content but 
don’t want to dedicate too much time to maintaining a website or blog. 

Arrow assumes familiarity with the terminal, git, and markdown.
The basic workflow of publishing content on an Arrow website 
consists of creating markdown files, editing them with a 
text editor, and publishing from the terminal.
